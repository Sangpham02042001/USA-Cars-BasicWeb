                    <p>As we prepare to flip the calendar on a year that’s been like no other, it’s a great time to give
                        yourself and your family a gift with four wheels. Buying a car at the end of the year can save
                        you big money, as automakers, dealers, and salespeople strive to achieve sales goals. They’re
                        also trying to sell the last of the 2020 models on their lots. Those factors come together to
                        make December one of the best times to take advantage of a deal.</p>
                    <p>What makes a deal a deal? Car deals come with cash back, an interest rate that’s below what banks
                        and other lenders are charging, or a blend of both. A cash back offer, or rebate, effectively
                        lowers the price of the car. A financing deal reduces the amount of interest you have to pay on
                        your auto loan. The best financing deals are 0% offers, which eliminate the cost of interest
                        entirely.</p>
                    <p>Taking advantage of a car deal takes some work upfront. You need to find the best incentives
                        carmakers are offering, know how to compare competing offers, and be ready to take advantage of
                        the deals. If you haven’t been in the market for a while, or you’re a first-time car buyer, you
                        should start your car-buying odyssey by reading our <a href="#">guide to buying a car</a>. It's
                        a great idea to be prepared before you start talking to dealers.</p>
                    <p>The coronavirus pandemic has changed the way you should approach the car-buying process. Instead
                        of spending hours at dealerships, you should do most of the work from home. The <a href="#">U.S.
                            News Best Price Program</a> can connect you with local dealers with well-developed online
                        sales processes and home delivery options.</p>

                    <h2>What are December's Best Car Deals</h2>
                    <p>This December’s car deals include a mix of massive cash back incentives and 0% financing offers
                        with terms as long as seven years. Some include generous helpings of both. They're available on
                        a mix of 2020 and 2021 models. In some cases, such as the cash back deals on the 2020 and <a
                            href="#">2021 Toyota Avalon</a>, you can save thousands by purchasing a nearly identical
                        2020 model.</p>
                    <p>There are several surprisingly large cash back deals available this month, including an $8,000
                        rebate on some <a href="#">2020 Lexus LS models</a>, $4,000 cash back on some <a href="#">2020
                            BMW X3 trims</a>, and $5,000 off the price of the <a href="#">2020 Toyota Avalon</a>.</p>
                    <p>Chrysler is offering massive cash back deals on the <a href="#">2020 Chrysler Pacifica</a>.
                        Combined with the $7,500 <a href="#"> Federal Electric Car Tax Credit</a> that most buyers
                        qualify for when buying the plug-in hybrid, you can save more than $15,000 off the sticker
                        price. The exact amount depends on where you live and the trim level you choose.</p>
                    <p>Shoppers looking for 0% financing deals have plenty of options this month. There are 0% deals on
                        vehicles ranging from the <a href="3">2021 Hyundai Sonata</a> to the <a href="#">2021 Subaru
                            Ascent SUV</a> and the recently refreshed <a href="#">2021 Jaguar F-Type</a> sports car. The
                        six-year 0% deal on the <a href="#">2020 Infiniti QX60</a> includes two years of no-cost
                        maintenance. Purchase a <a href="#">2020 Dodge Challenger</a> , and you get at least $10 cash
                        back per horsepower. That means you can get a $7,970 rebate on the 797-horsepower Hellcat
                        Redeye.</p>
                    <p>From Cadillac comes an excellent combination deal on the <a href="#">2020 Cadillac XT6</a>. It
                        includes six years of 0% financing plus $2,500 bonus cash. You can buy a <a href="#">2020 Nissan
                            Titan</a> in some parts of the country and receive a seven-year 0% loan and as much as
                        $3,000 cash back.</p>

                    <h2>How Can U.S.News Help You get a Deal</h2>
                    <p>At U.S. News Best Cars, we believe you haven’t gotten a good deal unless you’ve found a good car.
                        We offer many resources to help you get the right vehicle for your needs and budget, <a
                            href="#">find affordable financing</a>, successfully <a href="#">negotiate the buying
                            process</a>, and learn about getting the <a href="#">proper car insurance</a>.</p>
                    <p>Unlike publications that rely on the opinion of a single reviewer, U.S. News & World Report looks
                        at hundreds of new car reviews from the country’s top automotive journalists. We use their
                        consensus opinion, blended with quantifiable data on predicted reliability and safety, to come
                        up with a score for nearly every new car, <a href="#">truck</a>, <a href="#">SUV</a>, <a
                            href="#">wagon</a>, and <a href="#">minivan</a> you can buy. Those scores are then used to
                        rank vehicles against their peers. To ensure that you can trust our impartiality, our staff does
                        not accept expensive gifts or travel from automakers, and an outside company handles our
                        advertising.</p>
                    <p>In addition to their overall rankings, we offer consumers the ability to compare models based on
                        the individual factors they tell us are critical to their purchase decisions, such as predicted
                        reliability ratings and performance.</p>
                    <p>You can save both time and money by taking advantage of our <a href="#">Best Price Program</a>.
                        We work with local dealers to provide haggle-free, guaranteed savings off the MSRP. On average,
                        buyers shave more than $3,000 off the sticker price when they use the program.</p>
                    <p>Buying a new car is one of the last arenas of free-wheeling price negotiation, and that can be
                        intimidating even to savvy consumers. We’ll give you confidence going into the car-buying
                        process with articles on topics including how to get an auto loan, deciding whether to buy or
                        lease, the best way to negotiate a great price, and costly extras to avoid. We’ll even help you
                        with advice after you leave the dealership by showing you how to get the right auto insurance
                        coverage at a reasonable price.</p>
                    <p>The tips in the articles, such as having a pre-approved financing deal before you head for the
                        car dealership, can save you money now and throughout the life of your vehicle.</p>

                    <h2>What Is a Car Deal</h2>
                    <p>While Santa’s elves may be able to make just the right number of toys for the number of
                        children’s houses he visits, automakers aren’t quite as good at forecasting. Sometimes a car
                        needs a bit of extra help to get to a price where it will sell. Others sell great when they’re
                        first introduced but are harder to move when a replacement is right around the corner.</p>
                    <p>That’s where automaker-supported car deals come into play. They offer incentives for buyers that
                        lower the cost of the vehicle, its financing, or both. What’s the best part about car deals? You
                        don’t have to negotiate to take advantage of the money-saving offers.</p>
                    <p>Car deals fall into three main categories: lease, cash back, and financing. Automaker-subsidized
                        lease deals offer lower monthly payments, smaller amounts due when you start the contract, or
                        both. We track the best lease deals available on our <a href="#">lease deals page</a>. Cash back
                        offers lower the price you pay for the car, while financing deals reduce or eliminate the amount
                        of interest you pay on your car loan.</p>
                    <p>Though they are called cash back deals, the dealer won’t give you a pile of money before you
                        drive away. Instead, they reduce the price you pay for the car. Cash back incentives go by
                        several names, including rebates, bonus cash, and cash allowances, but they all work the same to
                        knock hundreds or thousands of dollars off the price you’ll pay.</p>
                    <p>We can illustrate how one works by looking at this month’s cash back offer on the 2020 Chevrolet
                        Equinox. You can take advantage of a $4,250 rebate, which knocks the price of a midrange Equinox
                        LT from $27,500 to $23,250.</p>
                    <p>Many buyers don’t consider the cost of interest on their car loan when making a purchase
                        decision, but it can be a significant expense. Getting a financing deal can reduce, or even
                        eliminate, the cost of interest on your car loan. Lowering the amount of interest you pay can
                        allow you to make smaller monthly payments, shorten your car loan, or even afford a nicer car.
                    </p>
                    <p>Let’s use the 0% deal available this month on the <a href="#">2021 Hyundai Sonata</a> to
                        illustrate how much you can save. We'll opt for a midrange Sonata SEL Plus with a price tag of
                        $28,200. To keep things simple, we'll say that you're not making a down payment or trading in
                        another vehicle. Since there's no interest to pay with the 0% deal, you simply divide its
                        $28,200 price into 72 equal payments. Each payment would be $392.</p>
                    <p>Doing the math to figure out interest can be a bit complicated, so we’ll use the U.S. News car
                        payment calculator to make it easy. Without the no-interest financing, you would have to pay the
                        market rate, which is currently around 4.2% for a six-year new-car loan. Enter the interest
                        rate, price, and length of the loan into the calculator's form, and it computes a monthly
                        payment of $444.</p>
                    <p>The difference in payment is $52 per month. Over the six years of the loan, you would pay an
                        extra $3,744 in interest. That’s enough for a substantial down payment on your next car.</p>
                    <p>While 0% deals offer the best possible interest rate, you can save money with any offer that’s
                        significantly below market rates. Of course, you should check with a bank or credit union to
                        find out what rate you qualify for before you assume that a car deal offers the best value.</p>
                    <p>The best car deals are reserved for customers with top-notch credit scores. With few exceptions,
                        consumers with challenged credit will have a hard time getting one of these great deals. If
                        that's you, you’re better off getting a pre-approved offer from your bank or credit union before
                        heading to the dealer. If you have bad credit, going into a dealer’s finance office unprepared
                        can be financially risky.</p>
                    <p>Occasionally, automakers offer special financing deals to customers with challenged credit. It’s
                        a good idea to ask a manufacturer’s online sales consultant about any such programs before you
                        head for the dealer.</p>
                    <p>Even if you have found a spectacular cash back or financing deal, you should still negotiate to
                        get the lowest possible price on the vehicle. Though a salesperson might tell you otherwise, you
                        should negotiate just as hard on the cost of a car with an incentive as you would on a car
                        without one.</p>
                    <p>New car deals come loaded with rules, restrictions, and fine print. Only specific models or even
                        trim levels of those models are subject to the deals. Some offers are limited to a certain
                        number of vehicles or a percentage of a dealer’s stock. Many deals only apply to car shoppers
                        who live in specific areas. You can contact your local dealer directly or chat with an internet
                        sales representative to verify that you qualify for the deal you’re seeking. Paying attention to
                        a deal's expiration date is essential. Miss it by even a day, and you'll likely miss out on the
                        discount</p>
                    <p>Buyers who are willing to invest a bit of time and travel into their car purchase can potentially
                        save even more money. Dealerships have manufacturer discounts and direct-to-dealer incentives,
                        so different dealers can pay the factory different prices for the same car. For the vehicle you
                        want, find a dealer who paid less for the vehicle or is trying to hit a sales goal, and they'll
                        have more room to negotiate a lower sales price. Inquiring at dealerships who sell a different
                        mix of vehicles than others can also get you a better deal. Call a rural dealer, for example, if
                        you're looking for a hybrid that may not be as popular in that area. Looking for a <a
                            href="#">full-size pickup</a> ? An urban dealer might make you a great deal.</p>

                    <h2>How Do You Know if It Is a Good Deal?</h2>
                    <p>Don’t assume that every advertised offer is a good deal. You'll want to do the math to see how
                        different offers compare, and which one saves you the most money. Avoid the temptation to
                        compare deals by simply looking at the monthly payment. While getting a monthly payment that
                        fits into your budget is essential, focusing on just the payment and ignoring other factors
                        could mean that you spend much more money in the long run. Instead, you want to compute the
                        entire cost of the car, including the interest you'll pay on your car loan</p>
                    <p>Car salespeople will offer to do all of the math for you, but it is critical you pull up the
                        calculator on your smartphone and do the math yourself. While they will want to keep you focused
                        on the monthly payment, you can do the math and see the total cost and ensure that no <a
                            href="#">costly extras</a> are included in the deal. The simple act of bringing out a
                        calculator sends a signal that you are a savvy customer.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, the math to determine a car’s total cost is easy. First, you use a car loan
                        calculator to determine the monthly payment by entering the price of the vehicle, the interest
                        rate, and the number of payments. Then multiply that payment by the number of months you'll be
                        paying on the loan to determine the total cost of your payments. Add your down payment and the
                        value of your trade-in to that number, and you'll have the total cost of the car. Here's an
                        example: You have a car loan with payments of $300 per month for five years (60 months), and you
                        are paying $2,000 down with no trade-in. Multiply $300 by 60, then add $2,000. The total cost of
                        the car is $20,000.</p>
                    <p>Car buying gets more complicated when you lump the price of the car, the cost of financing, and
                        your trade-in value into one transaction. An experienced salesperson will want to keep you
                        focused on the monthly payment and will tweak the other numbers to show you the payment you said
                        you could afford. As a smart buyer, your goal is to separate those components as much as
                        possible. Unless you are getting a financing deal, you can take the loan component out of the
                        mix by getting pre-approved for a financing deal at a bank or credit union. While the dealer
                        might be able to beat the offer you have, they won’t have any incentive to do so unless you have
                        a pre-approved offer in hand. You can take the trade-in out of the equation by selling it
                        yourself to a private party or another dealer. If you do sell it yourself, however, you might
                        end up paying more sales tax on your new-car purchase.</p>
                    <p>Many times, you’ll have an opportunity to choose between low-interest financing and a cash back
                        offer. You can do a little math to see which is the best deal, and you’ll potentially save
                        yourself some money. We’ll use two of the deals available on the <a href="#">2020 Chrysler
                            Pacifica Hybrid</a> to demonstrate how the math can lead you to the least expensive option.
                        We’ll assume you’re not making a down payment and don’t have a vehicle to trade in.</p>
                    <p>There's a choice of either six years (72 months) of 0% financing or $5,750 cash back when you opt
                        for a $45,745 Pacifica Hybrid Limited in some parts of the country.</p>

                <div class="car-deals-des">
                    <h2>Completing the Deal</h2>
                    <p>The last step before you can drive your new car home is signing the paperwork in the dealer’s
                        finance office. If you’ve been shopping all day, you probably just want to get the paperwork
                        over and get home. It’s vital, however, that you stay focused and not rush through all of the
                        documents you’ll be asked to sign.</p>
                    <p>You’ll want to read each one to make sure you understand what you are signing and to ensure that
                        it accurately reflects the deal you agreed to. Pay close attention to the price, interest rate,
                        length of the loan, and additional fees. Don't sign any document with errors or blank spaces,
                        even if you are told that they will be completed or corrected before the papers are submitted.
                        If you are pressured to sign an incomplete or incorrect document, it’s a red flag that should
                        have you stepping away from the deal.</p>
                    <p>Look out for costly add-ons or fees you don’t understand. Before you accept any add-ons, you
                        should price them from vendors outside of the dealership, such as your lender or auto insurance
                        agent. If a dealer can’t explain a fee to your satisfaction, you should not have to pay it.</p>
                    <p>Don't ever leave a dealership with a vehicle until you are confident that the purchase and
                        financing are finalized. Often a dealer will let you drive the car home while they complete the
                        financing you agreed to. Several days later, you'll get a call saying the financing deal was not
                        approved and you need to return to sign new paperwork. When you return, you’ll see that the new
                        financing is much more expensive than the original deal. It’s called Yo-Yo financing.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes there are legitimate reasons the original financing deal fell through, but unscrupulous
                        dealers will let you take the car knowing all along that you would not qualify for the original
                        financing deal. Their goal is to get you to fall in love with your new ride, and then lead you
                        to believe you have no choice but to agree to the new deal. If this happens to you, check with a
                        local credit union or community bank to secure financing before you return to the dealer. Be
                        prepared to give them back the car if they do not offer you a financing deal that is affordable
                        and acceptable.</p>
